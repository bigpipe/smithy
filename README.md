Preprocessing of CSS/JS meta-languages made easy through a singular API. Smithy
will not install preprocessing libraries until required. This is done to keep
the module as lightweight as possible.

## Advantages

- Liberal use of different meta languages, smithy allows preprocessing each language
  through a singular API.
- Quickly switch between available preprocessors, like node-sass vs. sass to
  accommodate your needs.

## Installation

Smithy is released in npm and can be installed using:

```
npm install smithy --save
```
